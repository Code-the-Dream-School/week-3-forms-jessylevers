JS for Blocking the Date: 
    let today = new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0];â€¨document.querySelector("#calendar").setAttribute('min', today);


Issues & Feedback:
1. Had a hard time trying to center my images properly, I'm still trying to figure that out 
2. Struggled to understand exactly how to make sure the input of the date was blocked. There wasn't anything in the lessons about it and even though I was given an example I struggled to understand where and how to apply it properly I would've liked more clarity on that. 
3. My text box on my application didn't show up as the example shown, so I struggled to fix that and it left my text box looking quite small.
